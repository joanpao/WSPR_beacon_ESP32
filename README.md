# WSPR_beacon_ESP32

It allows you to create a low-cost multiband WSPR TX (beacon) with an SI5351 board (8 kHz to 160 MHz with an output power of 8 dBm - 6 mW) and 
an ESP32 with GPS like the Lilygo ESP32 LoRa GPS 433MHz (Lilygo T-Beam) 

It's highly recommended to have:
- An RF receiver (e.g., SDR) to verify that the WSPR TX is transmitting and on what frequency
- A WSPR receiver to monitor WSPR or SPOTS transmissions

REMEMBER:  that to operate a WSPR beacon you need to have an amateur radio license. If you do not have one, it is very practical to have one and it is easier to obtain than a driver's license.
